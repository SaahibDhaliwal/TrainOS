Building (linux.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca)
========================================

Clone repo:
git clone https://git.uwaterloo.ca/dduranro/kernel.git
cd kernel
git checkout a9f0dc5c795f298e617402ce6c17b97d509f5340
make

That is, you type in the console 'make' to compile the program.

This will produce kernel1.img which should be deployed to the RPi and run. 
See the course web page for deployment instructions.

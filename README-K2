Building (linux.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca)
========================================

Clone repo:
git clone https://git.uwaterloo.ca/dduranro/kernel.git
cd kernel
git checkout 9a7ff21b3bb9042e0dfb5c05508eaadffb860bbe

make

That is, you type in the console 'make' to compile the program.

This will produce kernel1.img which should be deployed to the RPi and run. 
See the course web page for deployment instructions.
